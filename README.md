INTRODUCTION. 

  COVID-19 has overwhelmed the entire world, and India also has borne 
the brunt of the same.The spread was so colossal that the World Health 
Organization (WHO) had to declare it as a pandemic. The only way to control and 
defeat this mammoth pandemic was to make people follow social distancing and 
also to restrain them from moving out to avoid social connect. The impact of 
COVID-19 was seen in every sphere of life. The emergence of COVID-19 led the 
world to an unprecedented public health crisis. It had created an unstable 
environment for individuals, loss of business activities, loss of employment, 
education system, usage of digital platforms, effect on food and health habits of 
individual, etc. This had halted a large number of economic activities and routine 
activities because of infectious nature.  
                 Although COVID-19 has mostly affected the elder generationâ€™s health, it 
has also disproportionately affected youth (aged 30 and below) in almost every 
other significant aspect of their life creating a drastic change in their education, 
health, work, spirit, finances, emotions and overall environment resulting in us 
selecting of this topic. 
                  Education is the biggest sector that has been adversely affected by this 
pandemic. It forced many great nations to enforce lockdown thereby bringing 
everything to an abrupt halt for a certain period of time. Right from the big 
businesses to educational institutions this pandemic has literally altered and 
devastated the traditional ways of carrying out these things. The educational sector 
has been fighting to survive the crises. The teaching learning and evaluation 
methodologies have been completely altered by this pandemic. The digitalization 
of education became a necessity in order to provide seamless education. All the 
educational institutions in India had to be shut down right from the primary schools 
to the universities. The outbreak of COVID-19 had forced many states to enforce 
lockdowns that brought everything to a standstill including the teaching and 
learning process. According to the UNESCO report more than 90% of total student 
population in the India was affected due to the pandemic during the initial phase 
of its outbreak. It has caused a serious and very deep-rooted impact on the social, 
economic and also psychological life of people in different parts of the world. With 
the closure of educational institutions, the need for a rapid transition from physical 
learning to the digital sphere of learning emerged. 
 

Another effect was seen on the employment of the individual People lost 
their jobs, decrease in their daily wages, etc. were some factors that were observed 
during pandemic. Covid-19 halted a large number of economic activities because 
of infectious nature. Even in areas with relatively low disease risks, people were 
exposed to extensive communication about the risks of COVID-19, which was likely 
to have caused some of them stress. The measures to be adopted were the 
lockdowns, self-isolation, social distancing, which have a wide impact on the digital 
media consumption, to keep themselves occupied, people entertained, socially 
connected and be in touch with the friends and family. Digital platforms were the 
best option for people to be connected. Social networking has been evidenced to 
have both positive and negative effects on our youths.COVID-19 has silently and 
rapidly spread across India.
