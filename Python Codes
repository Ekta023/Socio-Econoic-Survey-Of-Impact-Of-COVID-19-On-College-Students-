Before_pandemic=[60,158,12,10]

Interpretation: It can be observed that there is notable difference in using cash for 
payments before, during and after pandemic. It was observed that before 
pandemic only a few number of students preferred UPI (BHIM/PayTm/Google Pay) 
as a mode of payment and it increased during pandemic. And there are very few 
using cards and net banking. Due to secure payments and it being convenient to 
use, most of the students use UPI for their regular payments.


Python commands –  
import matplotlib.pyplot as p 
responses=[13.1147541,20.4918033,21.7213115,73.7704918]

p.pie(responses,labels=mode_of_transportation,autopct="%2.1f%%") 
p.title("Pie-Chart") 
p.show() 
 
Interpretation: It can be observed that most of the students prefer private vehicles 
after pandemic. The number of students who prefer bus or auto rickshaw to other 
mode of transport is almost the same. Keeping social distancing norms in mind the 
preference for private vehicles has increased.

Pie-Chart for preferred mode of watching movies after pandemic. 
 
 
 
Python commands –  
import matplotlib.pyplot as p 
x=[115,118,82,100] 
platforms=["T.V.","OTT","Theatre","Downloaded"] 
p.pie(x,labels=platforms,autopct="%2.1f%%") 
p.title("Pie-chart") 
p.show() 
 
 
Interpretation: It can be observed that very few students prefer theatre to watch 
movie after pandemic which is better from social distancing point of view. Students 
preferring other platforms (OTT, T.V. and Downloaded) is almost the same.

lb=[0,10,30,50,70]

p.hist(y,interval,edgecolor="Black",color="Green") 
p.xlabel("Monthly family Expenditure") 
p.title("Histogram")

Monthly family expenditure Frequency 
10k - 30k 103 
30k - 50k 62 
50k - 70k 17 
Above 70k 15 
Below 10k 47 
Grand Total 244 

Interpretation: It can be observed that monthly family expenditure of students is 
positively skewed.
